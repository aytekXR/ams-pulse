# SESSION-83 — planned at S82 close (D-144) — §2.7 date-gate, else a bounded polish arc

> ## ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-17, D-145) — took Option B (bounded web test-coverage arc)
> Checked at open: today **07-17 < 07-23** so §2.7 stayed locked, and the operator had **not** answered the S82
> checkpoint → the plan's **Option B** (a concrete bounded arc over idling). Shipped a **test-only** coverage pass on the
> two lowest-covered web files (PR #158): `SettingsPage.tsx` **55.5→95.4% lines** (30.5→94.4% funcs) and
> `OnboardingWizard.tsx` **73.0→93.7% lines** (57.1→90.5% funcs) — +23 tests → **676** total, global lines ~76%. No
> app source changed → **no prod deploy** (`v0.4.0-98-g641b4e2`). typecheck/lint/build clean. No new operator item; the
> six S82 checkpoint decisions are unchanged. See `decisions.md` D-145, ROADMAP §2.34, and `sessions/SESSION-84.md`.
> Everything below is the original pre-session plan.

## ⚡ STANDING DIRECTIVE (operator, 2026-07-12) — carry into SESSION-84

Re-read ROADMAP-V2 §2 / `docs/assessment/` §5 and **choose the next-highest-leverage move.** Verify candidate status AND
product-viability against the code before committing. Take the verified CORE. Do NOT stop after one session — at close,
update all docs, record progress + operator-needs, continue until the roadmap is complete or a human/operator is
genuinely required. **Ultracode is on.** **Workflow-script gotcha:** no backticks in workflow prompt prose. `gofmt -l`
before every push; web gotchas (`vi.hoisted`, full `npm test` for coverage, binary embeds `web/dist`).

## THE FIRST THING TO DO AT OPEN: check the date + check for operator response

1. **CHECK THE DATE.** `date +%Y-%m-%d`. The §2.7 CI-promotion gate unlocks **≥ 2026-07-23**.
2. **CHECK `operator-expected.md`** — has the operator responded to the S82 checkpoint (F6, §2.6, §2.1, GHCR, §2.19,
   §2.12)? If they picked something, DO THAT (it's now scoped by them → highest leverage). If not, continue below.

## Lead — pick by the date/operator state

**A) IF today ≥ 2026-07-23 → §2.7 CI-promotions (the primary autonomous move).** Bounded, autonomous, high-signal.
- Read §2.7's spec in ROADMAP-V2. Flip the soft/advisory CI jobs (web-e2e, csp-e2e, e2e, docker-build — confirm the exact
  set in the spec) from advisory to **required** so they gate merges. This is done via the workflow gating and/or the
  branch-protection required-status-checks list.
- **CAVEAT:** if the promotion requires GitHub **branch-protection** repo-admin settings (which I cannot change), that
  part is operator-gated (§2.1) — do the workflow-side changes I CAN make, and surface the exact branch-protection
  settings to the operator in `operator-expected.md`. Don't claim it's done if the enforcing half needs the operator.
- Validate: a test PR still gates correctly (the jobs run + block on failure). Docs-close as usual.

**B) IF today < 07-23 AND the operator has not responded → a bounded, unobjectionable polish arc.** Prefer a concrete
move over idling, but do NOT start a large new work-stream the operator hasn't scoped (NOT F6, NOT §2.19). Good options:
- **Web test-coverage** on the low spots (`SettingsPage.tsx` ~50%, `OnboardingWizard.tsx` ~69% lines). Pure test
  additions — no behavior change, no prod deploy, raises the safety net. Bounded and safe.
- **`docs/assessment/documentation-gaps.md` completeness pass** — close concrete documented doc gaps (operator runbooks,
  API docs). Autonomous, GA-relevant. Verify each gap is still open before writing.
- These are single-PR arcs; still run the full test suite + CI. A test-only or docs-only change does NOT roll prod.

**C) IF the backlog is genuinely quiet across several ticks → scale the loop back.** Per the loop guidance, after ~3
consecutive no-op ticks, reduce to a low-frequency wait for the 07-23 gate / operator input rather than manufacturing
work. A test-coverage or docs arc (option B) is the preferred way to stay productive; only idle if even those are done.

## Pipeline (the standard loop)
1. **Verify-at-open:** git state clean (only Caddyfile). Check the date + operator-expected. Record **D-145 IN PROGRESS**
   in `decisions.md` (only if you take a code/docs arc). Branch `s83-d145`.
2. **Execute** the chosen lead. Contracts before code.
3. **Validate:** Go → mutation-prove + full 25-pkg suite; web → full `npm test` + build + typecheck + lint.
4. **Adversarial review** for any security-relevant change (a CI-gate or test-only change is low-risk; scale it down).
5. **PR → CI poll** → **squash-merge --delete-branch** → verify origin/main.
6. **Roll prod forward** ONLY if server/web SOURCE changed (a CI-config, test-only, or docs change does NOT). Stamped
   rebuild + 5-check smoke if it does.
7. **Close docs:** D-145, CHANGELOG (if user-facing), ROADMAP, RESUME rotation (→ SESSION-84), `operator-expected.md`,
   SESSION-83 CLOSED, SESSION-84 written. Re-arm the `/loop` (longer interval if quiet).

## Environment gotchas (carried)
- **Go only in docker:** `docker run --rm -v /home/aytek/repo/ams-pulse:/repo -v pulse-gocache:/go/pkg/mod -v
  pulse-gocache-build:/root/.cache/go-build -w /repo/server -e GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false golang:1.25 go test ./...`
  (25 pkgs). `gofmt`/`go` NOT on host PATH. Mutation copy `/tmp/pulsemut`; restore via `cp` (NEVER `git checkout`,
  D-096). Node at `/home/aytek/.local/bin/node`; CI installs web with `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`.
- **Prod deploy LOCAL** (this host IS prod): 5-overlay compose `DC_ARGS="-p pulse-prod -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f
  deploy/docker-compose.hardened.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.prod-tls.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.real-ams.yml -f
  deploy/docker-compose.backup.yml --env-file deploy/.env"`. Prod **v0.4.0-98-g641b4e2**; rollback `pulse-prod-pulse:pre-d143`.
  Container runs read-only rootfs — new server-side writes must target `/var/lib/pulse` or `/tmp`. 5-check smoke:
  version stamp, healthz 200, signed webhook 200 (HMAC from PULSE_WEBHOOK_SECRET), limits 512M/0.5cpu, 0 error lines.
- **Admin token** (side-effect-free GET only, never commit): gitignored `oguz-testing.md`. Prod API base
  `https://beyondkaira.com` with `--resolve beyondkaira.com:443:161.97.172.146`.
- **Never** restart/fix AMS; never `docker compose down -v` on prod; never `git reset/checkout/stash/restore <path>`
  (D-096; `git restore --staged` OK). **Do-not-commit:** `deploy/config/Caddyfile.prod` stays modified/unstaged (verify
  `git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q Caddyfile` is empty before every commit). Commit trailer `Co-Authored-By:
